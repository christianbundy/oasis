The problem is that edited messages aren't understood by other views, so you'll have weird problems like: if you post A and then edit it to say B, if you search for B you'll get nothing so you have to search for A instead.\n\nI think this is probably an improvement over *no editing allowed*, but it adds some funkiness and confusion about when edits work and when they don't.","files":null}]}
