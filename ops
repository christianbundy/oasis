Having to scroll to the top of the page always felt so silly, so a sidebar feels good.

I could put the left sidebar outside of the viewport on the left, but I'm not sure how it should be accessed. When trying out Piet's app I didn't notice that the left edge was swipe-able until I read about it in the documentation, but I'd like to keep the app free of sticky headers, footers, or modals. \n\nThe solution I'm leaning toward is a simple [sidebar layout](https://every-layout.dev/layouts/sidebar/#the-solution) where wide screens get a Patchwork-like layout and mobile gets a current-Oasis-like layout where you have to scroll to the top. Maybe with an additional \"swipe left\" menu for advanced users?
