But I don't want to disconnect my whole computer because I'm doing other things on the network.\n\n**What do you think is the correct solution to this problem?**\nI'd like to run SSB in offline mode to prevent it from sending any packets to the internet.\n\nExtra credit would be to have separate flags for local network peer finding vs. talking to pubs.\n\n(This would only impact the SSB server that Oasis runs for itself, not ones launched by other apps like Patchwork)\n\n**Are you willing to submit a pull request to implement this change?**\nMaybe.  Where can we tell the server to not touch the network?  Would we remove some plugins from the server, in flotilla?\nhttps://github.com/fraction/flotilla/blob/master/index.js","files":null}]}
